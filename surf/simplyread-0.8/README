SimplyRead
==========

SimplyRead is a simple program to remove unwanted distractions
from webpages, in order to better enjoy reading on the web. It
removes everything but the article from a webpage, displaying it
simply and attractively.

The program is packaged as an extension for several web
browsers, or as a standalone JavaScript program to integrate
into other browsers.

Running it multiple times switches between showing the original
page and the simple version.

This project is technically inspired by Arc90's Readability,
but aims to be much simpler, faster, and more usable. More
generally, it is inspired by Sean Birketts' *The Gutenberg
Elegies* and Nicholas Carr's *The Shallows*.

"The ever-present awareness of possibility to either make or
refuse choice, was to preempt my creating any meditative space
for myself"
 - *Sean Birketts, The Gutenberg Elegies*
